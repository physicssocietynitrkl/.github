# Physics Undergraduate Society

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the Physics Society NIT Rourkela.

The Physics Society is a student-led initiative dedicated to the rigorous, foundational, and discussion-based exploration of theoretical physics. In a world rushing to “complete the syllabus,” we slow down to understand each equation, its derivation, and its physical meaning. We believe mastery comes not from speed, but from clarity.

Here, we publish:
- 📝 Summaries of weekend discussions
- 📊 Physics simulations and codes
- 📚 Notes, presentations, and research references

Stay curious, and keep exploring the universe!
